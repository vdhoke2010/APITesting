When you do a pull request on a branch, you can continue to work on another branch and make another pull request on this other branch.

Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.

$ git pull
Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :

$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
Push the branch on github :

$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch. Add -u parameter to set-upstream.

You can see all the branches created by using :

$ git branch -a
